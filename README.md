Material and script for data and software class

This software project imports a .csv file into python, plots/exports a figure of the selected data within the .csv file,
writes a panda dataset into a .json file, and exports that .json file.

The data used in this software can be located in the "data" folder. The exported data from this software can be located 
in the "results" folder, whereas the .py files associated with this software can be found in the "src" folder. A .gitignore
folder exists in order to organize unimportant materials.
